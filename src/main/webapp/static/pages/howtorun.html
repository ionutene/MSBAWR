    <h2>To run automated tests properly, be sure the next steps are done:</h2>

    <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
        <h2>1. Automated tests code</h2>

        <div style="margin-left: 50px; margin-bottom: 50px">
            1.1 If you made any changes in tests code do the next steps , else skip entire step 1
            <ul>
                <li>Commit your code on SVN</li>
                <li>Go on <a
                        href="http://lxsrvmgi0205.mgi.de:8080/jenkins/view/MSBAdapter/job/AutomatedRegressionTests/">Jenkins
                    Project</a> and run a build or release (or wait 1 hour from the last commit, and auto build will
                    start :) )
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you created a release you have to Promote it as "Approved" and create one more build
                            after that
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Click on the REINDEX button <input id='reindex_bt' type='image'
                                                       style='margin-left: 5px; height: 35px' src='images/reload.png'>
                    (You must selected no environment)
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>2. MSBAdapter release version</h2>

        <div style="margin-left: 50px; margin-bottom: 50px">
            2.1 If the desired MSBAdapter version is already installed on the environment, skip entire step 2<br/>
            2.2 Be sure that the MSBAdapter release on <a
                href="http://lxsrvmgi0205.mgi.de:8080/jenkins/view/MSBAdapter/job/MSBAdapter/">Jenkins Project</a> that
            you want to test has:
            <ul>
                <li>Promotion status "QA Ready" - if not promote it</li>
                <li>One more build is created after promoted release - if you just promote a release, create a new
                    build
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>3. Run automated tests</h2>

        <div style="margin-left: 50px; margin-bottom: 50px">
            3.1 Select one environment - only tests for that environment will be available<br/>
            3.2 Select the desired tests<br/>
            3.3 Click Run :)<br/>
            <br/>
            NOTE: We recommend to run first the Installation tests (ALONE) and wait if the correct MSBAdapter version
            was successfully installed. After, un-check installation test and run the others tests (It is possible that
            installation test fail. This means all the others tests are useless ).
            If you installed manually the the MSBAdapter version on the environment skip "installation test"
